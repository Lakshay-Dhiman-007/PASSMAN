# PASSMAN 🔒

PASSMAN is a small experimental project I built for fun and learning.  
It takes user input, encodes it in hexadecimal, and compares results.  

⚠️ Note: Hex encoding is **not real security** — this project is meant as a playful experiment and a way to practice C programming.

## ✨ Features
- **Hex encoding**: Converts input into hexadecimal representation.
- **Minimal C implementation**: Written in pure C with no external dependencies.
- **Learning focus**: Built to explore encoding, string handling, and compilation basics.

## 🛠️ Compiling
You can compile PASSMAN using either `gcc` or `clang`:

```bash
gcc -o passman PASSMAN.c
```
or
```bash
clang -o passman PASSMAN.c
```    
## 🚀 Usage
```bash
./passman
