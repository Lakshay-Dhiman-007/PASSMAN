# PASSMAN 🔒

PASSMAN is a small experimental project I built for fun and learning.  
It takes user input, encodes it in hexadecimal, and compares results.  

⚠️ Note: Hex encoding is **not real security** — this project is meant as a playful experiment and a way to practice C programming.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Hex encoding**: Converts input into hexadecimal representation.
- **Minimal C implementation**: Written in pure C with no external dependencies.
- **Learning focus**: Built to explore encoding, string handling, and compilation basics.

---

## 🛠️ Compiling
You can compile PASSMAN using either `gcc` or `clang`:

```bash
gcc -o passman PASSMAN.c
```
or
```bash
clang -o passman PASSMAN.c
```    
## 🚀 Usage
```bash
./passman
```
## 📚 Motivation

I realized all my passwords were scattered everywhere —  
some scribbled in a notebook, some saved in the browser,  
others hiding in random notepad files. 🌀  

So I decided to write my own password manager.  
Not just a tool, but a little playground to learn, experiment,  
and add a few sprinkles of creativity along the way. ✨  

PASSMAN is the result: simple, honest, and written in pure C with love. ❤️
